## Note: This readme file and documentation still needs updating (10/1/24)

This repository contains code to generate 3D vascular models of the human liver. There are many classes central to the data structure, namely colony.py, branch.py, superlobule.py, node.py, attractor.py and segment.py. Models can be created in the manner outlines in main.py, as well as in many of the study specific files: nSLConvergence.py, PQGrid.py, tConvergence.py, and consistency.py. Their respective analysis files for generating plots and results are contained within the analysis folder. 

## Data Availability
Where available, results are made available in the results folder, but many of the files are too large to be hosted on Github. We provide all code necessary to generate these results, but files can also be made available upon request to <danielem@andrew.cmu.edu> or <lkara@cmu.edu>.
